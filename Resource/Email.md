# Email 1: Initial Request and Discussion
Subject: Website Rebrand & New Website Scope
Hi,
We are reviewing vendors for the rebrand and redevelopment of our corporate website and would appreciate your proposal and indicative pricing based on the scope outlined below.

Project Overview
We are rebranding from our current website (https://www.jadeclover.com/) to a new company name: Riviera Energy Pte Ltd. Reference on content can also be made on OGS Global company here: https://ogsglobal.co/.
 
The website’s primary role is to serve as a corporate credibility and validation platform, clearly communicating who we are, what we do, and the value we bring to clients.
 
Website Objectives
The new website should:
?       Establish Riviera Energy as a credible, professional energy consultancy and delivery partner
?       Clearly articulate our services and capabilities
?       Provide a clean, confident corporate presence rather than a marketing-heavy or sales-driven site

Core Scope & Structure
At a minimum, the website should include:
Services & Capabilities
Clear explanation of Riviera Energy’s:
?       Consulting capabilities
?       Delivery and execution support
?       Advisory services
-> These should be structured around three main service pillars, as outlined in the attached company deck.

Talent Engagement (Supporting Function)
?       CV submission capability
?       Job visibility / careers section
This is a supporting feature and does not need to be a complex recruitment platform.

Branding & Visual Direction
?       We do not currently have a full brand kit
?       Our company logo is attached
?       The look and feel should be derived from the logo and the attached company deck (clean, professional, industrial energy aligned)

Content (Copy & Imagery)
?       Full content development (copywriting and imagery selection) is required as part of the project
?       We can supply raw content, reference materials, or imagery where needed, but expect the vendor to lead on structure, refinement, and final presentation

Deliverables & Commercials
Please include in your proposal:
?       Proposed scope and approach
?       Estimated timeline
?       One-time build cost
?       Ongoing costs (if any), such as hosting, maintenance, or support
?       Assumptions and exclusions

If helpful, you may also suggest optional enhancements or phased approaches, clearly marked as optional.
We look forward to reviewing your proposal and discussing next steps.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
Thank you.

# Email 2: Follow-up and Clarification

Thank you for your patience.
As discussed on WhatsApp, here's what I am after & a quotation.
I would like to optimize Riviera Marine's website (www.riviera-marine.com) as I feel the layout is still not clean enough.
Photos wise I am still okay. 

I also need to add another page to capture the an Exclusive Product that we are presenting: SafeGlo light
https://mineglow.com.au/industries/led-strip-lights-for-oil-gas-industry/
https://safeglolight.com/ - I prefer something like this.

Can you let me know what your rates are?
& also for Company Capability document brochure, please let me know what you can do?

Thanks
