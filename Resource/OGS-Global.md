## Zero Carbon (/about/zero-carbon/)

OGS Global has gone beyond Net Carbon Zero, cutting GHG and CO2 emissions and energy use by a staggering 200%.

OGS Global's emissions framework is focused on reducing climate change and the transition to renewable energy, working towards a safer, cleaner, and more sustainable world.

### What is Net Zero?
Net Zero is defined as an equal balance between the amount of greenhouse gases that are put into the atmosphere as there are taken out. Nations and companies across the globe have set targets to reach Net Zero by a particular date to slow the rate of climate change.

### The Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve Project
With the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve Project, OGS Global's commitment to sustainability goes beyond the business practices we use every day. OGS Global has given money to Rimba Raya in Indonesia Borneo, which is a privately funded and economically viable alternative to cutting down trees. The reserve is the size of Singapore. It keeps the palm oil industry from hurting one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world.

In October 2021, OGS Global got rid of the Verra Registry Verified Carbon Standard VCU because the Rimba Raya Reserve offset a lot of carbon emissions. Each VCU is equal to one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) that a project cuts or gets rid of. VCUs are bought and retired by the final user as a way to offset their emissions.

This has been a big part of why our carbon emissions are -200% nett zero.

## ICORA® Framework (/icora/)

### Tagline
"Early engagement, integrated data-driven assurance, successful start-up"

### Overview
ICORA® provides readiness assurance for commissioning, start-up, asset integrity, and sustained operations and maintenance. The framework encompasses technology, process and a structured team to deliver outcomes.

ICORA® makes it possible for facilities to be designed, built, commissioned, and started in a safe, environmentally responsible and cost-effective manner.

During the project's lifecycle, ICORA® will manage and reduce Commissioning and Start-Up risks and make sure that Operational and Maintenance needs are taken into account.

### Key Benefits
- An integrated team, customer-driven with an owner-operator
- Early involvement, the right knowledge and experience at the right time
- Fast-track commissioning and start-up, reducing project duration and costs
- Maximise efficiencies, early cash flow and long-term sustainable operations and maintenance
- Early risk identification and mitigation, finding the showstoppers and taking action
- Drives a verification of readiness process, reducing manpower and turn-around time
- Safety focused, ensuring technical integrity at start-up

### Verification of Readiness (VOR) Process
ICORA® provides assurance that all aspects of Commissioning and Operational Readiness have been identified and defined, with systems and supporting documentation developed to achieve a smooth facility start-up and handover.

ICORA® uses a robust Verification of Readiness (VOR) process to determine key activities that need to be managed in the early stages of a project and throughout the project's lifecycle to reduce the impact on Commissioning and Start-Up (CSU).

### Framework Components
- Smarter Technology
- Smarter Process
- Smarter People

## Smarter People (/icora-framework/smarter-people/)

### Key Statement
An integrated ICORA® team should be part of the owner-operator's team from the early Concept / Feasibility phase.

### Specialist Experience Areas
The ICORA® framework is implemented by specialists with experience in:
- Engineering Design & Construction
- Completions & Commissioning
- Verification of Readiness Assurance
- Operations & Maintenance
- Safety and Technical Integrity

### Project Management Approach
The Team will establish an overall commissioning and operations readiness project schedule outlining all required deliverables and activities for meeting the Ready for Start-Up (RFSU) date. Progress is tracked via the ICORA® Application and reported directly to the owner-operator for full transparency.

### Strategic Implementation
This approach ensures design, procurement, factory acceptance testing, logistics and construction are pursued with a "commissioning first" mindset to avoid start-up bottlenecks.

### Benefits of Early ICORA® Team Engagement
- Improved asset data integrity, driving capital cost reductions and faster market entry
- Integrated construction and commissioning schedule management reducing costs through advanced work packaging
- Enhanced commissioning, operations and maintenance data handover processes for safe, efficient asset management
- Timely, accurate information reducing risk review time and asset location searches
- Improved procurement planning achieving spare part cost reductions
- Data and design reuse driving commissioning and start-up cost reduction
