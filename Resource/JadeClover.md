## Career Advice (/career-advice)

### Article 1: Presenting Yourself at an Interview

As the saying goes, first impressions count. In order to present your best self to your prospective employer, preparation is key. This is especially true for candidates who have made it to the interview stage of a job application.

Start your interview preparation by doing your homework and researching the company you are applying to work for. Re-read the job description and get to know the requirements of the position so that you can articulate how your past experience, knowledge and skills make you the right candidate for the role. Pre-empt some of the questions they may ask, memorise your answers and prepare an explanation for why you want to join the company. Jot down your own questions to highlight your genuine interest in the role.

On the day of your interview, double-check the location and leave plenty of time to get there as you don't want to be late or flustered when you arrive. If the interview is happening virtually, ensure you log on 5-10 minutes before so you can work through any technical difficulties before the interview starts. Punctuality demonstrates courtesy and is a big contributing factor to your first impression. Make sure you are dressed smartly, with a neat and tidy appearance as it shows that you have made an effort and that you value the interview opportunity.

When you first meet with your interviewer, greet them with a firm handshake and introduce yourself by your full name. Express your gratitude for the opportunity to be interviewed. When you are seated make sure to sit up straight facing your interviewer. During the interview, answer questions logically, truthfully and with clarity, and take care not to rush. Be aware of anxious or closed body language and maintain eye contact throughout. Conduct yourself in a professional manner at all times as your interactions with others may be noticed. Even if you are nervous, be engaged and let your personality and best attributes shine through.

When presenting yourself at an interview, ensure you stand out from the crowd by being confident in your preparation and remembering to smile.

At Jadeclover, our expert team has the knowledge and experience to help you prepare for success. Get in touch with us if you'd like to find out more about joining our pool of site-ready candidates.

### Article 2: Managing Mental Stress on Site — 5 Helpful Tips

Work can be stressful in any situation but it is often exacerbated for employees working in the oil and gas, energy and construction sectors due to the added strains of remote living, long shifts, exposure to climate extremes and irregular communication with the outside world. If not managed properly, stress can negatively affect your mental health and can lead to fatigue, loneliness and feelings of anxiety or depression.

Here are five tips to help you build an on-site routine that works for you and will help to manage and alleviate your mental stresses.

**Tip 1: Healthy body, healthy mind**
First and foremost, look after your physical health and well-being. Diet affects every aspect of your health, so be sure to make healthy meal and snack choices that nourish your body and to drink plenty of water. Follow it up by engaging in regular exercise before or after your shift.

**Tip 2: Limit alcohol and caffeine**
While it may be just what you feel like at the end of a long day's work, alcohol is actually a depressant and can alter mood, energy levels and sleeping patterns. Similarly, too much caffeine can increase feelings of anxiety. Make sure to limit your intake, keeping exaggerated mental health issues at bay.

**Tip 3: Get enough sleep**
Working on-site can disrupt your usual sleeping pattern but nonetheless, it is crucial that you are well-rested in order to stay alert at work and avoid adverse effects on your mental health. Lack of sleep can lead to fatigue, mood disturbances, poor concentration and impaired judgement.

**Tip 4: Practice self-care**
Self-care doesn't need to be elaborate or complicated, especially when you're on site. Do something that makes you feel calm and happy, which could mean reading a book, stretching, or meditating.

**Tip 5: Communicate and socialise**
Being away from family and friends for long periods of time isn't easy, so it's important to stay in touch with loved ones back home. At work, socialise with your workmates, lean on your on-site support network and be sure to seek support whenever you feel like your mental load is becoming too much to handle.

### Article 3: Tips for Writing a CV

A well-written curriculum vitae, also known as a CV or resume, is more than just a list of past experiences and qualifications. A CV that catches the eye of a prospective employer will highlight your relevant skills, competencies and knowledge and will emphasise why you are the best candidate for the position.

Before making a start on your CV, make sure you review the job listing and pay careful attention to the requirements of the role. Match your employment history and personal attributes with the role's responsibilities, required qualifications, preferred work experience and valued skills, and leave out anything irrelevant. Identify keywords and use them to build an engaging and impressive CV.

To make your CV stand out quickly, detail key information first. Lead with your primary credentials and achievements, such as accreditations, certifications, tickets, licences and skills. If relevant, briefly mention any equipment you can operate or computer programs you have experience with. Don't underestimate the value of work experience or volunteer work, as they offer insight into your practical skills and knowledge.

Including information about your personality may help potential employers determine whether you would be an asset to the organisation and whether you could work well in a team environment. Some examples of sought-after personal traits include honesty, accountability and diligence.

Before submitting your application, check over the finer details. Make sure your CV is concise and correctly formatted, that it includes your current contact details and that you have followed any specific instructions that were given.

At Jadeclover, we have the expertise to ready our candidates for any site. We have job vacancies in the oil and gas, energy, marine and construction industries and we're ready to connect you with your perfect role. Get in touch with us if you would like to send us your CV.
