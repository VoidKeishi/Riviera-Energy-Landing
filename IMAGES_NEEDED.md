# Images Needed for Website

Hi team — the site is ready for review. To complete it, we need the following images from your side.

---

## Team Headshots

Professional photos for the leadership section on the About page. Consistent style preferred (similar background, framing, lighting).

- Jason Antunovich
- Julianna Iris Tan
- Aisyah Adam

## Partner / Client Logos

The homepage features a scrolling logo bar of companies you've worked with. We need each company's logo as an image file (PNG with transparent background, or SVG).

Current list on the site:
ExxonMobil, Woodside Energy, Shell, BP, Santos, BW Offshore, Nabors, COSCO Shipping, Cyan Renewables, Twinza, Argo Marine, SOFEC, Yinson Production, IKM, UTEC Geo-services, Red Rock Oilfield Services, OMS Group, LD Armateurs, LD Travocean, SafeLink, AOS Offshore, Zamil Offshore, MODEC, Dana Petroleum

Please confirm this list is correct and up to date.

## Photography (Optional)

The site currently uses branded graphic panels as visual accents throughout. These work well as-is, but if you have any of the following, we can incorporate them:

- Office or team photos
- On-site project photography (platforms, equipment, crew)
- Any images previously used on the OGS Global or Jade Clover websites

No specific photos are required — the site is fully functional without them. But real photography adds credibility, especially for the homepage and service pages.
