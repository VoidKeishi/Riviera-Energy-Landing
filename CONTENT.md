## Copy Tone Guidelines

- **Voice**: Direct, measured, expert. First-person plural ("we", "our").
- **Sentence length**: Short to medium. No run-on sentences. Technical terms are fine — the audience knows the industry.
- **Claims**: Always backed with specifics. Not "many years" → "more than 30 years". Not "large database" → "~100,000+ specialists".
- **Avoid**: Superlatives without evidence, generic marketing language ("synergy", "leverage", "cutting-edge"), exclamation marks.
- **Formatting**: Bold key phrases in body paragraphs (matching deck style where important claims are bolded mid-paragraph). Use italics for taglines and pull-quotes.
